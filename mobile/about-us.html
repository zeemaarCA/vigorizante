  <div class="container about-us">
    <p>Incorporated in 2003, Our objective was to make the best herbal sex supplement for men in the market. We have long studied ancient remedies and ingredients from all around the world finding that many worked independently on libido, stamina, stronger
      erections, harder erections, premature ejaculation or erectile dysfunction. However, there was no one herb or ingredient which worked on all aspects.</p>
    <p>Food Science has come on leaps and bounds over the last two decades and we now, more than ever before, better understand how the body processes food, delivers nutrition to the body and exactly how they assist and deter biological functions.
    </p>
    <div id="more-text">
    <p>Herbialis has food technology at the heart of its research and development, we were able to break down why ingredients with known aphrodisiacal properties worked on certain aspects of our sex life and how they worked. Being able to nutritionally understand
      the processes behind the folklore and ancient practices of doctrines such as Chinese herbal remedies and Indian Ayurveda. From nature we selected and combined ingredients that were abundant in the properties we needed and used food technology to
      bind the properties and allow them to work on all aspects of our sexual health both individually and collectively.</p>
      <p>The latest formulation is the most potent and effective, 100% Natural and Organic herbal sex supplement ever made. It has taken over 20 years to combine the tens of thousands of hours of research with the top Nutritionists, working with Food Scientists
        and Herbalists, specializing in ancient remedies, to bring Herbialis into the marketplace. </p>
      <p>We're so confident that Herbialis will improve your sex drive, help smooth out your hormone balance, and improve your quality of life.</p>
      <p>In 1998 Pfizer introduced the chemical wonder product Viagra, this took the world by storm and was in 2003 followed by Cialis. These products were revolutionary as they head on bought to market a remedy for one of the most common yet undiscussed
        and sensitive problems that men face. Erectile Dysfunction was thrust in to the forefront of the media and market and suddenly there were ready made formulations that could be obtained via your GP. Word spread via the internet, it was now openly
        discussed in blogs and forums and became the focus of media attention and with that it became easier to talk about, to understand and men of all ages went to their GP’s to get help with this most personal of issues. </p>
      <p>The issues when they react with other medicines like Viagra and Cialis they simply make them dangerous so they are facing problems with both because these both are chemical and synthetic. They have the desired effect however at what cost? There
        are a host of side effects and use if one was to follow the GP’s instructions is limited, especially when older.</p>
      <p>Sexual health is an important (and fun!) part of everyone's lives. This is why Herbialis was born, we had been working with combinations of ingredients to attack various issues. With the impact of Viagra and Cialis and the increased demand we were
        determined to find a pure and natural herbal supplement with the power of both of the Viagra and Cialis without the side effects.</p>
